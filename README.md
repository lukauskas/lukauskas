### Hi there, I'm Saulius ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a postdoc in [Institute of Functional Epigenetics, Munich](https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/ife/index.html).
In my research I apply computational tools to biological problems. 

Together with my collaborators I try to define the role of histone post-translational modifications in transcriptional regulation.
Regretablly, I cannot yet share most of this work as it is still ongoing.

Meanwhile, this repository serves to host the code used in my [previous publications](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=iQGCYb4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), as well as small side projects such as python implementation of [MA plots and TMM normalisation](https://github.com/lukauskas/tmma), or visualisation of [recent batch of Lithuanian political opinions](https://github.com/lukauskas/seimo-rinkimai-2020) (in Lithuanian only). 

Additionally, you can always reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sauliuslukauskas/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/lukauskas_), or my [emplyoer](https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/ife/about-us/people/staff-detail/ma/6520/Dr.-Lukauskas/index.html).
